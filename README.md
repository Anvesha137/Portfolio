# Anvesha Rohatgi’s Digital Dojo 🥋

This repository is where ideas get tested, broken, rebuilt, and shipped.  
Not a highlight reel. A working lab.

Most projects here started with a simple question and ended with something usable.  
Sometimes elegant. Sometimes messy. Always honest.

## What this place actually is

A portfolio, yes.  
But more importantly, a record of **how I approach problems**.

You’ll see:
- ideas that evolved mid-build  
- projects at different stages of maturity  
- decisions documented instead of hidden  

If you’re looking for perfection, this isn’t it.  
If you’re looking for signal, keep reading.

## How to explore

Open any project that catches your eye.  
Each one represents a different way of thinking: experimentation, iteration, or shipping under constraints.

Some are complete.  
Some are still cooking.  
That’s intentional.

## Why I built it this way

Resumes list outcomes.  
This shows process.

I care more about:
- understanding systems than memorizing tools  
- shipping something useful than polishing endlessly  
- learning in public instead of pretending I “already know it all”

---

## What you’ll probably notice

- No tutorial clones  
- No buzzword padding  
- Clear intent behind every build  

If something looks simple, it’s because the complexity was removed, not ignored.

---

## Who this is for

- Recruiters who value thinking over keyword density  
- Collaborators who enjoy building from first principles  
- Anyone curious about how ideas turn into working systems  

If you reached this section, you’re already the audience.

## Final note

This portfolio isn’t about proving I know everything.  
It’s about showing I can figure things out, adapt fast, and ship responsibly.

I’d rather build something imperfect and useful than something elegant and irrelevant.
